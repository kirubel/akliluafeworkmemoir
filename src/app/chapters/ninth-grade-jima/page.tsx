              1959 was the year I completed my primary education, which is, eighth grade studies. I took the eighth-grade national exam at the same King Tekle Haymanot School, and I achieved high results, which gave me the opportunity to be assigned to Jima Agricultural School.
            </p>

            <p>
              This was my first choice to continue my ninth-grade education since Jima Agricultural School was one of the famous and renowned vocational schools at the time. My family and I were thrilled about the opportunity I received.
            </p>

            <p>
              That same year, three young students from Gojjam Province were also selected to join Jima Agricultural School. Among them were Gualu Endegnanew, Mulugeta Seyum, and me. When the rainy season ended and schools reopened nationwide, the three of us embarked on a journey to Addis Ababa.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since this was my first trip to Addis Ababa and my first time leaving my family for another city, I felt an overwhelming sense of excitement. On the eve of my trip, I was given long pants, or "bolale," and a pair of shoes. That was the first time ever I had a chance to wear something other than short pants and shoes.
            </p>

            <h2>The Interview Process</h2>

            <p>
              During our stay in Addis Ababa, we had two main tasks to complete. The first was to take an entrance interview for students who had been selected to join Jima Agricultural School from all over Ethiopia. Passing this interview was a crucial requirement. Secondly, we had to undergo a comprehensive health examination and obtain medical confirmation of our health even if we passed the interview.
            </p>

            <p>
              The entrance interview was conducted by Mr. Meisner, the American director of Jima Agricultural School, and the deputy director, Mr. Tesfa Bushen. The first round of interview was led by Mr. Tesfa Bushen. However, his questions on agriculture were quite challenging and the complexity of his English made them harder to understand. I wasn't able to meet his expectations during the test, which left me feeling disappointed and somewhat discouraged at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fortunately, since many of the other new students had similar experiences, it was decided that the interview should be conducted again. The next day, I had the opportunity to take the interview with the American director.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this second chance I was given, I remained composed and provided comprehensive answers to the questions posed to me. With a warm smile, the director shared the good news—I could head to Jima the very next morning to collect the funds for my travel. And just like that, the path ahead quietly opened.
            </p>

            <h2>Arrival at Jima Agricultural School</h2>

            <p>
              The next day, I boarded the bus from Addis Ababa to Jima and arrived at Jima Agricultural School the same day, albeit in the late afternoon. As soon as I reached the bus station, numerous young people began calling my name and introducing themselves. They explained to me in a warm and friendly manner that they were senior students at my new School. They regularly assist new students arriving at the school from the bus station, helping them settle in.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overwhelmed with gratitude, I arrived at the school compound in a peaceful state of mind.
            </p>

            <p>
              These same young people then showed me around my dormitory room, the bed, bathroom, dining hall, classrooms, and sports fields. Everything I saw was like a dream, a testament to the modernity and spaciousness of the facilities. When they showed me the school's dining hall and kitchen, it was unlike anything I had ever seen or tasted before—fried meat and milk flowing freely from large barrel-like containers. I couldn't help but express my profound gratitude to the divine for assigning me to Jima Agricultural School.
            </p>

            <h2>The Onset of Homesickness</h2>

            <p>
              On my arrival in Jima, I settled into my assigned dormitory room and was told that I would sleep on the upper bunk bed. After a few minutes, I approached a student in the room and inquired about Gualu Endegnanew, a student who had arrived two days before me. The boy replied, "Yes, I know him! As it turns out, yesterday he went to harvest teff and, upon his return, fell ill. He went to the clinic and might be resting there."
            </p>

            <p>
              When I heard that, something came over me, that gave me a strange feeling, made me feel numb, my head spun, my heartbeat increased, I was very shocked and scared. Even worse, when I looked out the window at the trees and plants outside, none of them moved, they didn't seem alive, everything seemed quiet and still. I stayed a little longer and asked myself, "Is there no wind in this country? What do they breathe? How do they live?"
            </p>

            <p>
              At this time in Debre Markos town, it's the time when the air, wind, mud, dust, trees, and leaves are all swirling. "What kind of country have I entered!" I said, filled with anxiety. My friend Gualu was nowhere to be found that night, adding to the eerie stillness that surrounded me.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a short span of time, I experienced moments of joy and wonder—but they quickly gave way to a wave of anxiety and fear. What lingered in my mind wasn't the school's impressive services or the conditions I had admired earlier. Instead, my thoughts drifted back to Debre Markos, the town I had left behind, and most of all, to my father and our family. Their absence echoed louder than anything I had seen.
            </p>

            <h2>The Decision to Leave</h2>

            <p>
              The night passed with nightmares, terror, and tossing and turning. When morning came, I told my new companions that I was very homesick and that the climate in Jima was not suitable for me, then I went back to my bed and slept. When I finally came out of my room, everyone who saw my condition was very shocked and saddened; they tried to comfort me, strengthen me and get me acquainted by sharing their personal stories as examples.
            </p>

            <p>
              After listening to all of them, I asked again, "Where is my friend Gualu?" Someone told me he heard that Gualu had returned to Addis Ababa yesterday and left the school to go to his home town in Debre Marcos. This was the end of the line for me, I decided that this place was definitely not for me, so I should also leave and return to Debre Markos. I asked them to take me to the director's office.
            </p>

            <p>
              The deputy director didn't think this was a serious issue and said that if I was sick, I should go to the clinic to be treated immediately. I went to the clinic for examination, and it was reported to the deputy director that I had no illness and was completely healthy. After reviewing the report, he ordered me to return to my studies without any further delay.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the time being, I accepted the instruction and for a day or two wandered around the compound and began to receive books and educational materials from the library and store. However, the situation continued to get worse day by day and I felt that I could not live in Jima and learn anything being separated from my father and relatives. Within less than a week, I went to the main school director's office and repeatedly pleaded with them, crying, to send me back to my hometown.
            </p>

            <p>
              The American director was very kind and gentle, someone who never wanted to hurt anybody's feelings. He believed in discussion and advice rather than force and anger. Calmly and patiently he repeatedly advised and counseled me not to leave the school. Finally, since my spirit, and entire being was disturbed, I firmly expressed my desire to return to Gojjam by any means.
            </p>

            <p>
              The director, very saddened by my decision, said, "Well then, if you've decided to return, you can go," and wrote a letter of withdrawal to be given to the Ministry of Education in Addis Ababa and ordered that my transportation costs be paid. I also took the letter of withdrawal which stated that I left the school because I was homesick. I then returned to Addis Ababa by bus.
            </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <p>
              This decision to leave Jima Agricultural School, driven by overwhelming homesickness, would prove to be one of the most significant turning points in my life. While it seemed like a failure at the time, it set me on a different path that would eventually lead to teaching, university education, and a career I could never have imagined.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometimes what appears to be a setback is actually providence guiding us toward our true destiny. The homesick boy who couldn't stay away from his family would grow into a man who would serve his country and continent, always carrying with him the deep appreciation for home and family that this early experience had taught him.
