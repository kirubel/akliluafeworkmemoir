# Introduction

I share these pages as a keepsake for generations of our family—a thread of memory woven through time. This memoir begins in the early chapter of my life, just after completing eighth grade, when a quiet encounter gently marked the start of my story.

I completed my primary education at King Tekle Haymanot School in Gojjam Province (as it was called then), and I grew up in the town of Debre Markos in a neighborhood called "Wuseta." I continued my studies in ninth grade in Debre Markos, where the first unforgettable encounter of my youth gently unfolded—a moment etched in memory, marking the true beginning of my story.
